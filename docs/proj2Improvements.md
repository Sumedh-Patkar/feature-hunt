# Feature Hunt
## Project 1 vs Project 2

After analyzing the project from the previous group, we recognized that they had mainly focused on implementing a frontend but lacked a backend with their product. 
Our focus quickly because adding to the backend to enable the frontend to be more dynamic, in addition to fixing bugs and adressing feedback from the previous group.
For the second project we had four main extensions that we wanted to implement. 

## 1. Sign Up and Login
The first thing we extended was a sign up and login page so that each user would be able to have their own accounts. This is an entirely new task that our group
did independently. This included adding new user data into MongoDB, creating backend services/APIs, and designing new React forms.

## 2. User Products and Features
Now that we have users who can access the system, the second implementation we did was adding functionality to associate users with specific products and features.
On the frontend, this allows users to only see the products that they are working on, add new projects, and give updates through tags.

## 3. Deployment
The third feature we looked into extending was looking to deploy the product on heroku and netlify. 
By deploying we are essentially delivering the application from the developer to the users and can gather feedback to see what we can improve. 

Here's where it is deployed - [Feature-Hunt](https://feature-hunt-25.netlify.app/)

## 4. Update to Quality
Lastly, our final implementation was to update the project form of the previous group. 
- Originally when the user clicked on the submit project tab, it would send the user to a google form to fill out, this was enhanced so developers are not forced add
and review products. 
- we added lots of comments!
- we added lots of test cases!
- improved coverage from ... to ...
