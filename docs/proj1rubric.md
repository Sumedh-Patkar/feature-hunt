| Notes|Self-assement|evidence|
|-----|------|---------|
|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits|3||
| Number of commits: by different people|2||
| Issues reports: there are **many**|3||
|  issues are being  closed|3|evidence in GH|
| DOI badge: exists |2|in GH|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly|2 |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |2||
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|2|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|2||
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|2||
| Use of version control tools|2||
|Use of  style checkers |2|config files in GH showing your config|
| Use of code  formatters. |2|config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
| Use of syntax checkers. |2|config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
| Use of code coverage |2|config files in GH|
| other automated analysis tools|2|config files in GH|
| test cases exist|2||
| test cases are routinely executed|2||
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|2||
| issues are discussed before they are closed|2|every issue is dicussed by all, then assigned to one appropriate person for closure|
| Chat channel: exists|2||
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|2||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|2||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|2||
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2||
|short release cycles | 2||
|Documentation provide a clear, high-level overview of your software||
|Documentation clearly describes the type of user who should use your software||
|case studies to show how your software has been used by yourself and others||
|Documentation includes a "quick start" guide that provides a short overview of how to use your software with some basic examples of use.||
|Documentation provides clear, step-by-step instructions on how to deploy and use your software.||
|A comprehensive guide to all your softwareâ€™s commands, functions and options.||
|If your software can be used as a library, package or service by other software, do you provide comprehensive API documentation?||
|Troubleshooting information that describes the symptoms and solutions for problems.||
|Documentation stored under revision control with your source code.||
|Do you publish your release history e.g. release data, version numbers, key features of each release etc. on your web site or in your documentation?||
