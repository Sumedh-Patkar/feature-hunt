|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits|3|https://github.com/shahrk/feature-hunt/graphs/commit-activity|

| Issues reports: there are **many**|3|https://github.com/shahrk/feature-hunt/issues|
|  issues are being  closed|3|evidence in GH|
| DOI badge: exists |2|in GH Readme|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly|3 |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |2||
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|2|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|2| Logo, Description in Readme|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3| in GH Readme|
| Use of version control tools|0| Small scale project, can use in future |

| other automated analysis tools|2|config files in GH|
| test cases exist|3| a lot of them are added in GH|
| test cases are routinely executed|3|in GH|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3| Refer to the file in repo|
| issues are discussed before they are closed|2|every issue is dicussed by all, then assigned to one appropriate person for closure|
| Chat channel: exists|3| Google meet was used for communication|
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|2||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|2||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|2||
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2||
