Feature Hunt is a platform that allows you to do just that. Users can share/vote/discuss feature requests and product owners can organize them to make better product decisions üéØ.

React (P.S. we use hooks)  
JavaScript  
Python3  
Flask  
MongoDB  
HTML  
CSS  

Although we haven't used any CSS library for the FrontEnd, the users can easily merge it with any CSS library of their choice (e.g. Tailwind CSS, react-bootstrap).

## Getting Started with (Feature Hunt) Development

### First Time Setup

In the project directory run `git config --local core.hooksPath hooks` to make sure you have access to the Git Hooks.
Run the following commands in order:

### `npm install`

Installs the dependencies for the React App

### `pip install -r api/requirements.txt`

Installs the requirements for the Flask API

### `yarn start`

Runs the React app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

###  `yarn start-api`

Runs the flask API in development mode.\
The API runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Requests made to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) that don't exist on the react server are automatically forwarded to this API

## Other Available Scripts

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
